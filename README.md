# Metis_Challenges

Over the summer I attended Metis' Data Science Bootcamp. 
During the bootcamp, we completed challenges intended to build our skills in various areas of data science. 
Included are the first seven challenges I completed as well as the final eight that I am currently working through.

In each challenge's folder, a readMe lists the objectives of the challenges as well as a data set if required. 
My solutions are then found in the "challenge_set_\[#\]_brendan.ipynb" file.

| Challenge # | Description                            | Skills Demonstrated                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

| 3           | Exploration of Movie Data              | Pandas, MatPlotLib, Data Cleaning  |

Enjoy!
