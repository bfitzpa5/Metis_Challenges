# Metis_Challenges

Over the summer I attended Metis' Data Science Bootcamp. 
During the bootcamp, we completed challenges intended to build our skills in various areas of data science. 
Included are the first seven challenges I completed as well as the final eight that I am currently working through.

In each challenge's folder, a readMe lists the objectives of the challenges. 
The corresponding files then my solutions as well as the data set if required.

Enjoy!
