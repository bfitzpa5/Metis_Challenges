# Metis_Challenges

Over the summer I attended [Metis' Data Science Bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps "Metis' Bootcamp Page").
During the bootcamp, we completed challenges intended to build our skills in various areas of data science. 
Included are the first seven challenges I completed as well as the final eight that I am currently working through.

In each challenge's folder, a `README.md` file lists the objectives of the challenges as well as a data set if required. 
My solutions are then found in the `challenge_set_[#]_brendan.ipynb` file.
