    "It's a list of dictionaries. One dictionary per review: perfect for a mongo document.\n",

    "    Frank Zappa\n",
    "    Nun Desecration\n",
    "    THE MEAT\n",
    "    Beyond his metal sainthood for battling the censor-witches of the PMRC and getting named checked by Deep Purple in â€œSmoke on the Waterâ€, musical visionary Frank Zappa led many rock fans to heavy metal.\n",
    "    And, from there, he led many metal fans to the outer expanses of rockâ€™s possibilities.\n",
    "    Zappa also opened countless banging heads to the far reaches of jazz, classical, doo-wop, and any other art form that could involve (brilliant) noise and (brilliantly dumb) dirty jokes.\n",
    "    200 Motels is Zappaâ€™s first crack at major motion picture madness, and it\n",
    "    embodies the much forgotten cultural moment when acid rock tumbled forever into the black pits of rising heavy metal.\n",
    "    Surrealistic sketches and psychedelic set pieces about the insanity of a being on tour are interspersed among performances in which the Mothers jam with London Philharmonic.\n",
    "    Ringo Starr plays Zappa during the talking parts. Zappa himself, plays guitar throughout, demonstrating how very much of a six-string maestro he was, every lick on par with his future collaborators Steve Vail and Yngwie Malmsteen.\n",
    "    SOLID METAL NUGGETS\n",
    "    - A psychedelic cartoon interlude admiringly tweaks Black Sabbath and Grand Funk Railroad.\n",
    "    - Keith Moon, madman drummer of the Who, pops upâ€”and offâ€”as â€œThe Hot Nun.â€\n",

    " 'year',\n",
    " 'sections']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Basically, each section in the review is parsed into it's own key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, put these documents into a mongodb collection. For these challenges, do not use the `heavy_metal_reviews` list directly. Use mongo queries (you can use the mongo client directly or use pymongo from within python).\n",
